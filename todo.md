# TODO list for the analysis repo

1. Create a readme file for the repo top directory
  - make sure to reference where one can access the data, as well as where
    to get the pyto_segmenter package
2. Create all of the relevant directories for each figure
3. Add relevant datasets (ex. csv-format output from segmentation) to each directory:
  - Figure 1 __DONE__
  - Figure S1
  - Figure 2
  - Figure 3
  - Figure 4
  - Figure 5
  - Figure 6
4. Trim analysis R scripts to exclusively contain relevant data
5. Create an instruction markdown file for segmentation that will apply to all
  of the imaging:
  - Instructions for camera normalization where relevant
  - Instructions for segmentation of objects for each experiment
    (values for command-line parameters, etc.)
    _do I want to just do this within each folder for each expt separately?_
